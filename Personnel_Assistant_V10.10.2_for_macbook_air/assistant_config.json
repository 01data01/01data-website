SDAC, hosted by San Diego State University (SDSU), is a 3-month series of events (March to May 2025) that seeks to fund founders by activating angel investors who raise funds to invest in the winner of the pitch competition. Through a series of evaluations and pitch events, investors arrive at 6 finalists who pitch at the SDAC finale on June 5, 2025. The SDAC application deadline is February 27, 2025. \r\n\r\nEvent Format\r\n\r\nPitch Deconstruction is a popular Brink event that allows entrepreneurs to practice their pitch in front of an audience and hear feedback and advice from SDAC investors. It's a great way to get visibility, introductions, and practice. Here\u2019s how it works: Founders line up and present their 1-minute pitch to SDAC investors and the audience. SDAC investors give overall feedback. All attendees vote on their favorites. The presenters with the top 3-5 votes come back and deliver a 3-minute pitch with slides and where they get 1:1 feedback from SDAC investors that we all can learn from. Come prepared to pitch! Pizza, soda, and a bottle refill station provided.\r\n\r\nWhat to expect: \r\n\r\nPresent your 1-minute pitch\r\nHear what\u2019s trending among entrepreneurial startups\r\nBe prepared to present a 3-minute pitch with slides\r\nHear advice and best practices from SDAC investors\r\n",
